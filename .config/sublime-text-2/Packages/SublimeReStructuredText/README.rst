Sublime reStructuredText
========================

Overview
--------

This Package is for nice syntax highlighting of reStructuredText.  Best 
viewed with sunburst and twilight color schemes.

For have nice highlighting out of the box, it has many tweaks in scope 
names, that is instead of having right semantic names, it rather has names,
which are highlighted by most of color schemes.  Color schemes have to 
support markup.\* scopes better...

Headings and terms (from definition lists) are available as symbols, so
you can use ``CTRL-R`` to jump to them.

.. note:: Creation of this syntax definition was the motivation for 
    writing SyntaxHighlightTool_.
